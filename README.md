# Dooble
Basic Python Script to create dooble style card game

The code is pretty hardcoded.
Folder "imagenes" and "tarjetas" is needed.
Imagenes should contain 57 pictures in png. In tarjetas A4 pictures will be created with the cards.

Future:
It would be nice to code it nicer, create a nice pdf and generate the cards matrix with a function.
Maybe one day.
